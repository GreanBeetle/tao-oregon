* Build out authentication for google, email, and facebook
* Welcome page will have feed of most recent trail reports
* Implement google maps API showing locations of all trails
* Weather API showing weather conditions for trails
* Allow users to post pictures of trails
* Build out distance algorithim from current location by creating algorithim using current lat lng, and target lat lng


## MVP

* User authentication
* Admin protected route to add trails to database
* Googles maps to display clusters of trails
* API call for weather conditions
